# is
Inspired by jQuery method `.is()`, this library is a simple way to check whether the current element matched against a selector.

# Installation
To install `is`, simply execute:
```shell
  npm install is_dom
```

or Bower too:
```shell
  bower install is-dom
```

Or pick up the minified file.

## Browser Support
* Chrome 1.0+
* Firefox 4.0+
* Internet Explorer 8.0+
* Opera 10.5+
* Safari 3.2+

## How to use?
`is` doesn't depend on jQuery or any other library to work. You need only to include the script at the end of your HTML code. Then it will add the method `.is()` in the Node object.
